# Challenge04
For this challenge I created a coding quiz to test your knowledge about some common JavaScript questions! 
Right here I have the starting screen where you will click the start quiz button to begin the quiz and then a countdown timer will begin as you start to answer questions.

After the quiz is over, the game over screen will show and will display your final score!

There are still some bugs with storing the final score but in the interest of time, I decided to leave the quiz as is and will be fixed later on.
